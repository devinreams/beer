# The Gubernator Pale Ale v2 (Stomp Them Grapes/Hop to It!)

_Original Gravity: 1.052_
_Final Gravity: 1.012_
_ABC: 5.2%_

## Ingredients

- 8 oz Medium Crystal
- 6 oz CaraPils
- 7 lb Wheat Liquid malt extract
- 1 oz Perle hops
- 3 oz Cascade hops
- 1 tsp Irish moss (clarifying agent)
- US-05, Wyeast 1056, or White Labs 001

## Directions

1. Remove the Wyeast pack and "smack" as instructed
2. Heat 1.5 gallons of water to 160 F, remove from heat
3. Place crushed specialty grains into a small muslin bag and steep for 30 minutes
4. Remove grains and allow excess water to drip off, discard grains
5. Add 7 lb Wheat liquid malt extract
6. After the extract has dissolved, top pot to comfortable boil volume, return to heat
7. When rolling boil, add 1 oz Perle hops
8. After 45 minutes, add 1 oz Cascade hops and 1 tsp Irish moss
9. After 15 minutes, add 1 oz Cascade hops
10. Remove pot from heat and chill as quickly as possible
11. Once wort is cooled below 80 F, pour into primary fermenter
12. Top off to 5 gallons with cool water
13. Stir with spoon to aerate, record starting gravity and pitch Wyeast 1010
14. Place lid and airlock on and ferment at 62-72 F
15. After 7-10 days take another gravity reading (it should within 2-8 points of the final)
16. Rack the beer into a carboy for secondary fermentation and add 1 oz Cascade hops (dry hop)
17. Agitate the carboy once a day to get the hops to sink into the beer (swirl gently)
18. After another 14 days, take another gravity reading (it should be close to the final)
19. Rack beer into bottles (condition for 14 days) or a keg
